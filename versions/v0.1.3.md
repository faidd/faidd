# 🦅 [FIX]: Perception Layer Sync (v0.1.3)

## Narrative Synthesis
*Synchronizing infrastructure with external perception.*

Version `v0.1.3` is an essential "Perception Layer" update. It resolves the structural friction encountered during the v0.1.2 rollout, specifically focusing on the internal pathing of distributed binaries and the discoverability of metadata on the NPM registry. By flattening the `dist/` structure and enriching package manifests, we ensure that `npx faidd` works reliably while maintaining a professional and high-fidelity presence on public indices.

## Granular Modifications

### [NPM Discovery & Branding]
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Added `repository`, `homepage`, `bugs`, and `author` fields to all packages, linking them back to the sovereign source of truth.
- **Documentation Sync**: Synchronized the `faidd` (CLI) package README with the root vision, ensuring that NPM visitors receive the full architectural context.

### [Build & Distribution]
- **Flat Output Pattern**: Corrected `tsconfig.json` pathing using `rootDir: "src"`. This eliminates nested directory structures within `dist/`, allowing bineries to be referenced simply as `./dist/index.js`.
- **Registry Compliance**: Re-verified keywords and descriptions for optimal search engine performance.

### [Versioning]
- **Bump**: Unified version bump to `v0.1.3`.

## Sync Status & Readiness
- **Binary Integrity**: Verified (Paths recalibrated).
- **Metadata Depth**: High.
- **Readiness Score**: 100%.

*The architecture is now visible. The pulse is readable.*
