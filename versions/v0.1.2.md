# 🏷️ v0.1.2 - Nerve System Initialization

## Motto: **Nerve System Initialization**
*Injecting the first electrical impulses into the FAIDD infrastructure.*

## Executive Summary
This minor release transitions FAIDD from a static repository structure to a dynamic, buildable monorepo. It introduces the first functional source files, establishing the link between core types, logic, and the CLI.

## 🛠️ Changes

### [Infrastructure & Engineering]
- **ESM Standardization**: Added `"type": "module"` across all workspace nodes to align with modern Node.js standards.
- **TypeScript Wiring**: Established a robust `tsconfig.json` hierarchy, enabling seamless cross-package imports using workspace protocols.
- **Turbo Shield**: Configured `packageManager` metadata to resolve build environment inconsistencies.

### [Functional Stubs]
- **CLI Heartbeat**: Implemented the first functional entry point in `tools/cli`.
- **Logic Core**: Developed initial helper functions for agent management in `core/logic`.
- **Type Definitions**: Documented the fundamental `Agent` and `Rule` interfaces in `core/types`.

## 📊 Impact Analysis
- **Build Integrity**: 100% success rate on `pnpm build` across all nodes.
- **Developer Experience**: Functional `index.ts` files ready for B-MAD Engine injection.
- **NPM Readiness**: Validated dry-run for all scoped packages.

*Note: A framework is only as strong as its first pulse.*
