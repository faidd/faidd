# v0.1.8 - The Sovereign Identity (B-Mad Evolution)

## Release Overview
This version cements FAIDD as the elite, sovereign successor to legacy orchestration frameworks. It focuses on tactile structural authority and a premium visual identity for the autonomous age.

## Key Accomplishments

### 💎 Tactical Visual Authority
- **ASCII Monument**: Refined the FAIDD monument art with high-impact "Sovereign" dotting and electric gradients.
- **Subtitle Alignment**: Officially subtitled as `Framework for Ai Driven Dev` to emphasize the core mission.
- **Elite Status**: Version indicators and status boxes optimized for authority.

### 🛡️ Sovereign Hierarchy (Bunker/Brain)
- **Bunker Sub-Structure**: Added `rules/`, `sessions/`, and `rights/` to `_faidd/`.
- **Strategic Brain**: Added `logic/` as an optional operational layer in `faidd/`.
- **System Memory**: Integrated `resources/` for static assets and `_config/custom/` for update-protected user overrides.
- **Agent Sovereignty**: Relocated agents to the Bunker root for immediate human accessibility.

### 🚀 Frictionless Distribution

- **Core Packaging**: The `core` module is now natively bundled with the CLI for immediate, offline-ready bootstrapping.

## Documentation
