# v0.1.8 - The Intelligence Singularity

## 🧠 Release Overview

Version 0.1.8 marks the evolution of FAIDD from a tactical tool to a **Cognitive Encapsulation Framework**. This release cements the "Intelligence Frame" narrative, decoupling project-level reasoning from system-level orchestration through a new **Clean CLI Architecture**.

## 💎 Tactical Identity & Visuals

- **The Intelligence Frame**: Complete rebranding of the README as a high-fidelity cognitive scaffold.
- **Visual Assets**: Integrated `banner faidd.png` and `faidd-terminal.png` for a premium onboarding experience.
- **Dynamic Star History**: Fixed social proof tracking via live SVG integration from `star-history.t9t.io`.
- **ASCII Monument**: Refined the FAIDD monument with tactical "Sovereign" dotting and electric cyan gradients.

## 🏗️ Clean CLI Architecture (v2)

- **Logic Separation**: Removed all business logic duplication from the CLI source code.
- **Root Sovereignty**: Established `/core` at the project root as the single source of truth for agents, rules, and logic.
- **Dynamic Injection**: Implemented an automated build pipeline that "aspires" the root core into the CLI's `dist` package for seamless NPM/NPX distribution.
- **Dual-Mode Resolution**: The CLI now intelligently detects if it's in development (root access) or distribution (package access) mode.

## 🛡️ Sovereign Hierarchy (Bunker/Brain)

- **Bunker Sub-Structure**: Established `rules/`, `sessions/`, and `rights/` within `_faidd/`.
- **Strategic Command**: Integrated `faidd/analysis` and `faidd/planning` as the primary operational layers.
- **Agent Authority**: Relocated agents to the Bunker root for absolute cognitive proximity.

## ⚖️ Documentation & Onboarding

- **Walkthrough 0.1.8**: Comprehensive guide to the Identity & Structure pivot.
- **Cinematic Messaging**: Rewrote CLI installation sequences to reflect the "Intelligence Frame" establishment.
