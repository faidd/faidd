## Reporting a Vulnerability

As a security framework, FAIDD takes vulnerabilities extremely seriously. If you find a security issue, please follow these steps:

1.  **Do not open a public issue.**
2.  Email a detailed report to security@bmad.dev.
3.  Include a proof-of-concept if possible.

We aim to acknowledge all reports within 48 hours and provide a timeline for resolution. We follow a responsible disclosure policy; we ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability until it has been patched.
