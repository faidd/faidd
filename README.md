# 🛡️ FAIDD: The Intelligence Encapsulation Framework

**FAIDD is not a code generator. It is the Sovereign Perimeter where code is born.**

Most AI orchestration tools (like legacy B-Mad) focus on the output—generating files, pushing commits, writing boilerplates. They treat the AI as a simple worker. **FAIDD treats the AI as a strategic entity** that requires a high-fidelity environment to function at peak performance.

## 🧠 The Mission: Cognitive Scaffolding

In unorganized environments, AI agents suffer from **Cognitive Fragmentation**. They get lost in the noise of your root directory, misinterpret your project rules, and eventually "drift" away from the mission. 

FAIDD establishes an **Intelligence Frame**—a physical and logical scaffold that encapsulates the agent's reasoning. By enforcing a strict hierarchy between system-level memory and project-level execution, FAIDD ensures that every token generated by the AI is aligned with your absolute strategic intent.

---

## 🚀 The Three Pillars of Sovereignty

### 1. High-Fidelity Encapsulation

FAIDD wraps your development session in a **Sovereign Perimeter**. It's the difference between coding in a crowded street and coding in a high-tech command center. Your AI is "shielded" from project noise, allowing it to focus 100% of its attention on the task at hand.

### 2. Tactical Alignment (Bunker vs. Brain)

We enforce a strict **Physical Decoupling** of project consciousness:

* **The Bunker (`_faidd/`)**: The immutable core. It holds the "Soul" of your project—your agents, your governance rules, and your session history. It is the system of record.
* **The Brain (`faidd/`)**: The operational command. It's where the deep analysis and architectural planning happen. It is the tactical layer of the project.

### 3. Multi-Agent Mastery

FAIDD isn't built for one tool. It is the **Cognitive Layer** for the world's most powerful AI IDEs. Whether you use **Cursor, Claude-Code, Windsurf**, or local LLMs, FAIDD provides the uniform structure they need to understand their mission with zero friction.
