# @faidd/logic

The implementation layer for the core security and cryptographic algorithms of the FAIDD framework.

## Core Implementations

### Verification Engine
A robust set of utilities designed to evaluate proposed operations against the active security manifest. This engine ensures that mission constraints are respected at every step of the agent's interaction.

### Cryptographic Integrity
Logic for maintaining and verifying the ledger's integrity chain. It handles the hashing processes that link each operation to its predecessor, ensuring an immutable and auditable history.

### Protocol Management
Internal service logic for enforcing the B-MAD development protocols, managing system state, and handling IPC communication protocols.
