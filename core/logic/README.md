The core implementation of FAIDD's security and auditing algorithms.

## 🧠 Key Logic
- **Rules Engine**: Evaluates file operations against the active permission manifest.
- **Crypto Ledger**: Handles the "Integrity Chain" logic, ensuring each entry is cryptographically linked to the previous one.
- **Sovereignty Verification**: Verifies that the local environment matches the security policy.
